# Clean Code Principles - Refactoring Code

This project focuses on refactoring code by applying key Clean Code principles.

## Principles Applied:
1. **Meaningful Names**:
   - Renamed variables, methods, and classes to have meaningful, descriptive names. This improves code understanding, readability, and maintainability.
   
2. **Divide Code into Methods**:
   - Split large chunks of code into smaller, more focused methods, each with a clear and singular purpose. This enhances readability and makes the code easier to test.

3. **Divide Code into Classes**:
   - Refactored the code into appropriate classes, grouping related methods together. This improves code organization, encapsulation, and reduces complexity.

## Features:
- Improved code structure by using meaningful names, dividing the code into methods and classes.
- **Each method/class has a single responsibility**, making the code easier to read and test.
- **Improved maintainability** by adhering to Clean Code principles.

## Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbenezerAssefa/FinalSnakeGame.git
